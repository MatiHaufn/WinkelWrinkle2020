# WinkelWrinkle_KriMaBaMi

This is project from 2020 created by a group of four people (Kristoffer Nagel, Sebastian Voigt, Michelle Than and me) during my Game Design study at the HTW Berlin. 
Since this is my first bigger Unity project, I plan to work on the old code and see, how I improved since then. 

# Gameplay 
The game is a small 3D Jump and Run and Puzzle game. 

The setting of this game is a childs room and toys. 
Here is, how you can interact with the environment: 
- switch between 3D and 2D appearance
- folding objects to open ways
- push objects away 

You can find some Gameplay here:

# My Role 
I was the main programmer in this project.
I created the code for the main mechanics, especially the switch between 2D and 3D.
